                Security
            </h2>
            <p>
                The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to
                protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.
                Invoice Generator ensures that all customer billing and payment information, files and data remain
                private and confidential. Due to the sensitive nature of billing and payments we take this very
                seriously and make it our primary concern for all customers. We restrict access to personal information
                to Invoice Generator employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to
                operate, develop, or improve our service. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and
                may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these
                obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at the
                contact information below. We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as
                needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our
                agreements.

            <p>
                Upon request Invoice Generator will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your
                personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by
                logging into your account or by contacting us at the contact information below. We will respond to your
                request within a reasonable timeframe. In certain circumstances we may be required by law to retain your
                personal information, or may need to retain your personal information in order to continue providing a

            <p>
                Invoice Generator acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Invoice
                Generator has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An
                individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct
                their query to the Invoice Generator’s Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will
                respond within a reasonable timeframe. In certain circumstances we may be required by law to retain your
                personal information, or may need to retain your personal information in order to continue providing a
                service.
